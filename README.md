1. Nodejs - Available at https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
3. In VS Code, at the root, run "npm install" (without the quotes). This pulls down all the packages needed to run the app.
4. In a terminal session, run "ng serve" (without the quotes). This serves up the content using node.
5. Add a new terminal session, and run "node server" (without the quotes). This starts up the server component.
